# Intelligent Congestion Management Incorporating Fair Re-Routing

### Abstract
Traffic congestion in large cities is on the rise as urbanisation and economic growth
rapidly increases, congestion costs billions of GBP annually and massive losses of time.
Current congestion management techniques greedily shift drivers around the congested
area with no concern regarding causing future congestion along the path. Furthermore,
some drivers may be re-routed too often causing frustration and ignoring requests given
by the system. This paper proposes a novel intelligent congestion management system
which takes a centralised approach aiming to reduce congestion for the individual and the
entire network. The system collects real-time data from vehicles to proactively navigate
the user through congested areas with minimal interruption. The system shall aim to
evenly distribute the density of vehicles across the network as to minimise and alleviate
congestion. Additionally, my work shall focus on the fairness aspect of re-routing. Drivers
should all equally see improvements in their travel time and average speed.
