# Fair _k_-Shortest Paths Re-Routing for Congestion Management

### Abstract
Traffic congestion in large cities is on the rise as urbanisation and economic growth rapidly increase.
Congestion cost U.K drivers over Â£37.7 billion in 2017, additionally to massive losses of time. Many congestion management techniques greedily shift drivers around congested areas with no concern of effects on future congestion on the road network. Furthermore, current systems may often cause frustration and are subsequently discontinued. This paper investigates the benefits of introducing fairness into congestion management systems and proposes a centralised approach to fairly alleviating congestion using existing prevalent path-finding algorithms, with the goal to reduce congestion over a road network. This project proposes a novel modification to existing $k$-shortest path algorithms, which doesn't currently take into account any measure of fairness. The system uses fairness metrics to proactively re-route vehicles through congested areas with minimal frustration for the driver.  Results gathered supported the conclusion that drivers experienced less re-routings and subsequently shorter journeys.
